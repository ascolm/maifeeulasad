Take this as an example : 


  <img alt="Qt" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Qt-41cd52?style=flat-square&logo=Qt&logoColor=white" />


First pick a badge you want. As we picked `Qt` so `alt=__alt_text__`, if the image doesn't get loaded, a plain text will be shown saying **Qt**, or whatever you put.

Now the icon part :
https://img.shields.io/badge/-__another_text_displayed_inside_logo__-__color_of_the_badge__?style=__i_only_know_about_flat__-__shape__&logo=__github_topic_logo__&logoColor=__inside_color__


 - `another_text_displayed_inside_logo` is used mainly if the topic isn't avaiable on GitHub it will be rendered, it'll be rendered anyway. It helps to easily understand the logo. We may miss the icon sometimes. Nah.
 - `color_of_the_badge` is just color. But I can tell you for sure, these color scheme finding is sometime hard. So just download an icon, use a color picker. I use [this online tool](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/), or [this one](https://github.com/maifeeulasad/EasyPaint).
 - `shape` - you can put round or something else. You can check out [there website](https://shields.io/), and try finding.
 - `github_to_pic_logo` - whatever topic you want target you can target. But if that topic doesn't exist on GitHub you won't get that logo. Maybe there is some other way around hacks, but I don't know them. But this should be mentioned that [Spring](https://github.com/topics/spring) has it's own topic, but Spring Boot doesn't, so you can't get a Spring Boot icon in you readme. But [Spring's icon](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&hs=FeP&channel=fs&sxsrf=ALeKk00nlw-2mbdYqoi8tNirMmVrQLWn8g:1607845684135&q=spring+icon&tbm=isch&chips=q:spring+icon,g_1:java:6hOFSxjWN2E%3D&usg=AI4_-kSSNVltINhyCunFP4PVTqmdhKpSBg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_yez2u8rtAhURb30KHS-WBtsQgIoDKAJ6BAgCEA4&biw=1299&bih=662#imgrc=v17ZfzFn6fy_uM) is way more different than [Spring Boot's icon](https://www.google.com/search?q=spring+boot+icon&client=ubuntu&hs=BeP&channel=fs&sxsrf=ALeKk029pza29K0O2r_TyOxdsRizt57rQA:1607845680157&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=7Cgi8_dVHe8lYM%252CrdoBlvx87qC_kM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kTJ4Ix6f_RnE1cwRzvd4YTQrvDmJg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjk-vn0u8rtAhWXbSsKHfKOCb4Q9QF6BAgPEAE&biw=1299&bih=662#imgrc=7Cgi8_dVHe8lYM). So it confuses actual developer base. And I also had to put the [same icon](https://github.com/maifeeulasad/maifeeulasad/blob/master/README.md#L29-L30).
 - `inside_color` - in which color, it is being rendered. I use white, someone I know uses white, someone he knows also uses white. Everyone uses white. 

Alvida. If anyone has more question fire away. Or if you want to tell me something, you know now the discussion is here.
